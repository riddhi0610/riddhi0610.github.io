            <h3>extracurriculars</h3>
            <p>To stay engaged with my community, I joined UW Computer Science Club, progressing from Event Coordinator to Senior Events Lead Coordinator. To be affiliated with my heritage, I practiced Kathak for 9 years, an Indian classical dance form. I'm an active Bollywood Hip-Hop choreographer in UW Dhamaka. Moreover, I am learning ASL from the Renison Continuing Education. My motivation stemmed from a desire to connect with the ASL community and contribute to them through my IASLR project. I co-founded NEO Club in high school. For a deeper insight into all my extracurricular involvements, feel free to read the descriptions provided below:</p>
